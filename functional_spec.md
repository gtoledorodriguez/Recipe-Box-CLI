# Recipe Box CLI - Functional Specification
## Introduction
Recipe Box CLI is a  Ruby CLI (command line interface) application that allows users to manage a collection of recipes. Users can add new recipes, and view and edit existing recipes.
The app solves the problem of keeping track of multiple recipes in one place, allowing users to quickly access and update their personal recipe collection.
## User Stories
### Basic Operations
1. As a user, I want to add a recipe with a name, ingredients, and instructions, so that I can save my favorite recipes for later use.

2. As a user, I want to view a list of all saved recipes, so that I can quickly see all the recipes I have entered.

3. As a user, I want to view the details of a specific recipe (including ingredients and instructions), so that I can refer back to it when needed.

4. As a user, I want to edit an existing recipe (name, ingredients, or instructions), so that I can update the recipe whenever necessary.
